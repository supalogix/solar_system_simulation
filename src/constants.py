# Universal gravitational constant (G): determines the strength of gravity
# in Newtonâ€™s law of gravitation (attracting masses over a distance).
G = 6.674e-11 * u.m**3 / (u.kg * u.s**2)

# Speed of light in vacuum (c): the ultimate speed limit for any signal
# or object; appears in relativity formulas for time dilation.
c = 3.0e8 * u.m / u.s

# We use mpf to preserve many significant digits, since time dilation
# effects are extremely small and require high precision summation.
